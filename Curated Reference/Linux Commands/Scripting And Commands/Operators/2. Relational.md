# Relational Operators

- Are used for comparing numbers and string.

- Often used with if, while loops for condition checks.

## Numeric Relational Operator:

- Used only for numeric value checks.

| **Operator** | **Description**              | **Example**            |
|--------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| `-eq`        | Equal to                     | `[ $a -eq $b ]`        |
| `-ne`        | Not equal to                 | `[ $a -ne $b ]`        |
| `-lt`        | Less than                    | `[ $a -lt $b ]`        |
| `-le`        | Less than or equal to        | `[ $a -le $b ]`        |
| `-gt`        | Greater than                 | `[ $a -gt $b ]`        |
| `-ge`        | Greater than or equal to     | `[ $a -ge $b ]`        |

**One Liners:**

```bash
> a = 1
> b = 2

> [ $a -eq $b ] && echo "$a and $b are equal" || echo "Both are not equal."
# Output: Both are not equal.

> [ $a -ne $b ] && echo "$a and $b are not equal" || echo "Both are equal."
> 1 and 2 are not equal.

```

> Common Syntax for one liner is: ``[ <test_condn> ] && <if_true> || <if_false>``

**With Loop:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
a=1
b=2

if [ $a -eq $b ]; then
    echo "Both are equal."
else
    echo "Both are not equal."
fi
```


## String Relational Operator

| **Operator** | **Description**                                   | **Example**              |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `=`          | Strings are equal                                | `[ "$str1" = "$str2" ]`  |
| `!=`         | Strings are not equal                            | `[ "$str1" != "$str2" ]` |
| `<`          | String 1 is less than String 2 (lexicographically) | `[ "$str1" \< "$str2" ]` |
| `>`          | String 1 is greater than String 2 (lexicographically) | `[ "$str1" \> "$str2" ]` |
| `-z`         | String is empty                                  | `[ -z "$str" ]`          |
| `-n`         | String is not empty                              | `[ -n "$str" ]`          |

> Note that escape character `\` is required for `<` and `>`. For string comparision, it does so by comparing string lexicographically.

> **Note that: space around [] is required. i.e: [ <test_condition> ]**

```bash
> [ "asd" = "asd" ] && echo "Strings are equal" || echo "Strings are different."
# Output: Strings are equal

> [ "abc" != "def" ] && echo "Strings are different" || echo "String are same."
# Output: Strings are different.

> [ "a" \< "b" ] && echo "Lexicographically a is less than b" || echo "Lexicographically a is greater than b."
# Output: Lexicographically a is less than b

> [ "b" \< "a" ] && echo "Lexicographically b is less than a" || echo "Lexicographically b is greater than a."
# Output: Lexicographically b is greater than a.

>  [ "b" \> "a" ] && echo "Lexicographically b is greater than a" || echo "Lexicographically b is less than a."
# Output: Lexicographically b is greater than a

# Empty string check
> [ -z "" ] && echo "Empty string" || echo "Non empty string"
# Output: Empty string

# Non Empty String
> [ -z "asd" ] && echo "Empty string" || echo "Non empty string"
# Output: Non empty string

> [ -n "asd" ] && echo "Non empty." || echo "empty string"
# Output: Non empty

> [ -n "" ] && echo "Non empty." || echo "empty string"
# Output: empty string
```

**Usage with conditionals:**

```bash
if [ "$a" == "$b" ]; then
    # stmt
fi

if [ "$a" != "$b" ]; then
    # stmt
fi

# note the escape character
if [ "$a" \< "$b" ]; then
    # stmt
fi

# empty check
if [ -z "$a" ]; then
    # stmt
fi

# non empty check
if [ -n "$a" ]; then
    # stmt
fi
```

**Tips:**

- We can use: ``[[ <condition> ]]`` to avoid the escaping of the characters. For example.

```sh
[ "1" > "2" ] && echo "A less than b."
```

> Note that the above command wont work as expected without escape character `\`. 
> Without `\` it would be interpreted as a redirection operator.

```sh
> [[ "1" < "2" ]] && echo "A less than b."
# Output: A less than b.

> [[ "1" == "1" ]] && echo "true" || echo "false"
# Output: true
```
