# Uers Permissions

- Defines what action can a user, group can perform in the system.

- Actions modes: ``read`` a file or folder, ``write`` into a file, ``execute`` a script.


## What does `ls -l` gives:

- Long listing of files and folders in current directory.

```bash
<permission> <no_of_hard_link>  <user_owner>  <group_owner> <file_size_in_bytes> <last_modified_date> <last_modified_time> <file_name>
```

```bash
ls -l
drwxrwxr-x 2 test surya 4096 Dec 10 12:33 folder
```

- ``drwxrwxr-x`` => Permission
- ``2`` => Hard Link Number
- ``test`` => Usser owner of file
- ``surya`` => Group owner of file
- ``4099`` => File size in bytes.
