# Linux Group Management Commands

Groups basically are the collection of users:

A user can have:

- **Primary groups** => **created on user creation by default** **group name is same as username.**

- **Secondary groups** Other groups assigned manually.

```bash
id "$USER"
# uid=1003(test) gid=1003(test) groups=1003(test),100(users)
```

In the above case, user `test` has:
- Primary group: ``1003(test)``
- Secondary group: ``1003(test),100(users)``

> Note that user can have only one primary group but can have multiple secondary groups.

## Points To Remember:

- **When user is created, by default a group with same username is created and is the primary group of user**

```bash
# create a new user: foo_user
sudo useradd foo_user

# details of new user: foo_user
id foo_user 
# uid=1005(foo_user) gid=1008(foo_user) groups=1008(foo_user)
```

Here, a group ``foo_user`` is created and is a primary group of the ``foo_user``


- **When creating a file/directory, owner is a user who creates it, group owner is user's primary group.**

```bash
# current user groups, id info: primary_group = foo_user
id foo_user
# uid=1005(foo_user) gid=1008(foo_user) groups=1008(foo_user)

# create file and directory
touch file
mkdir folder

# view directory info
ls -l
total 4
-rw-rw-r-- 1 foo_user foo_user    0 Dec  9 18:35 file
drwxrwxr-x 2 foo_user foo_user 4096 Dec  9 18:35 folder
```

Here, a new file created has:
- Owner (User): 1st ``foo_user``
- Group Owner: 2nd ``foo_user``


## 1. Group File:

Informations about a group are stored in: ```/etc/group``` file.

```bash
cat /etc/group

# group3:x:1006:
# new_user:x:1007:
# foo_user:x:1008:
# test_group:x:1009:test,surya
# test_group1:x:1010:test
```

Here, this flie represents:

```bash
# group_name:password_placeholder:GID:group_members
test_group:x:1009:test,surya
```

- ``test_group`` => Group Name
- ``x`` => Placeholder for group password. 
- ``1009`` => GID (Group ID)
- ``test,surya`` => Group of user in the test group.

> If groupid <= 999 its a system created group.

> If groupid >= its a custom created group.

- **system groups:** ``cat /etc/group | awk -F: '$3 <= 999'``

- **Custom groups:** ``cat /etc/group | awk -F: '$3 >= 1000'``

## Some Handy Commands:

- ``groups <user>`` to view the list of group user belongs to.

```bash
groups "$USER"
# test : test sudo users
```

- ``getent group <group>`` to get the group entry line for ``group`` from ``/etc/group`` file. This is similar to ``cat /etc/group | grep '<group_name>'``

```bash
getent group tests
# tests:x:1055:
```



# Group Management:

## 1. Create a new group:

- ``groupadd`` => More commonly used and available.

```bash
# create a group with id
sudo groupadd -g 1052 tests

# test if group exist: Thus group is created
cat /etc/group | grep tests
# tests:x:1052:

# without id
cat /etc/group | grep newgroup
# newgroup:x:1053:
```

For more options check with: ``groupadd --help`` or ``addgroup --help``

## 2. Delete Existing Group:

- ``sudo groupdel <group_name>``


```bash
# delete a group
sudo groupdel tests

# check if deleted or not
cat /etc/group | grep "tests"
```

**Note that, if `group_foo` is primary group of any user, it cannot be deleted.**

```bash
# users primary group => test
id
uid=1003(test) gid=1003 groups=1003,27(sudo),100(users)

# try to delete group test
sudo groupdel test
# groupdel: cannot remove the primary group of user 'test'
```

## Modify / Update existing group.

- **Update group id:** ``sudo groupmod -g <integer_group_id> <group_name>``

```bash
# get groups entry
getent groups | tail -5
# test1:x:1001:
# clear:x:1002:
# test:x:1003:
# newgroup:x:1053:
# tests:x:1055:

# lets modify the test user group id to 123123
sudo groupmod -g 123123 test

# groupid updated to => 123123
getent group test
# test:x:123123:
```

- **Update group name:** ``sudo groupmod -g <integer_group_id> <group_name>``

```bash
# group test detail
getent group tests
# tests:x:1055:

# update groupname to new_test
sudo groupmod -n new_test tests

# note the id, 1055 its same: while the name got updated
getent group new_test
# new_test:x:1055:
```


## Add or remove user from group:

Note that, this way just adds or removes user from secondary group.

- Add a user to group: ``sudo gpasswd -a <username> <group_name>``

```bash
# No users in test group
getent group tests
# tests:x:1056:

# add user to tests group
sudo gpasswd -a test tests
# Adding user test to group tests

# verify: user added to test group
getent group tests
# tests:x:1056:test
```

- Remove a user from group: ``sudo gpasswd -d <username> <group_name>``

```bash
# test user in tests group
getent group tests
# tests:x:1056:test

# remove test user from tests group
sudo gpasswd -d test tests
Removing user test from group tests

# verify: user removed from tests group
getent group tests
tests:x:1056:
```

**Note that similar behaviour can also be achieved using: ``sudo usermod -<a/r>G <groupname> <username>``**
