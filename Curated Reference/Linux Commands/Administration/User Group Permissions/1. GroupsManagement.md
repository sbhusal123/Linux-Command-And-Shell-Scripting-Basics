# Linux Group Management Commands

Groups basically are the collection of users:

A user can have:

- **Primary groups** => **created on user creation by default** **group name is same as username.**

- **Secondary groups** Other groups assigned manually.

```bash
id
# uid=1003(test) gid=1003(test) groups=1003(test),100(users)
```

In the above case, user `test` has:
- Primary group: ``1003(test)``
- Secondary group: ``1003(test),100(users)``

> Note that user can have only one primary group but can have multiple secondary groups.


When an os is installed it comes with multiple groups for managing os level permissions internally. Each linux system has a builtin groups, which are a system groups. **System groups have group id between 1 to 999** while a normal groups have group id greater or equal ``1000``

## Points To Remember:

- **When user is created, by default a group with same username is created and is the primary group of user**

```bash
# create a new user: foo_user
sudo useradd foo_user

# details of new user: foo_user
id foo_user 
# uid=1005(foo_user) gid=1008(foo_user) groups=1008(foo_user)
```

Here, a group ``foo_user`` is created and is a primary group of the ``foo_user``


- **When creating a file/directory, owner is a user who creates it, group owner is user's primary group.**

```bash
# current user groups, id info: primary_group = foo_user
id foo_user
# uid=1005(foo_user) gid=1008(foo_user) groups=1008(foo_user)

# create file and directory
touch file
mkdir folder

# view directory info
ls -l
total 4
-rw-rw-r-- 1 foo_user foo_user    0 Dec  9 18:35 file
drwxrwxr-x 2 foo_user foo_user 4096 Dec  9 18:35 folder
```

Here, a new file created has:
- Owner (User): 1st ``foo_user``
- Group Owner: 2nd ``foo_user``
